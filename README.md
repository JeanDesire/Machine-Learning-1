# Machine-Learning
Machine learning Beginning using python libraries like numpy,scipy,matplotlib,pandas etc.

Linear Regression:
   --Model is trained with training data
   --Applying linear square fit method to predict the hypothetic function 
   --Hypothetic function using gradient descent algorithm for minimization of cost function
   --Trainning data is taken from:- https://www.kaggle.com/andonians/random-linear-regression/version/2
Polynomial Regression:
   --Comparing polynomial regression on data set with linear regression
Classification Algorithms
   --K-nearest neighbours (KNN) with implementation
   --Support vector machine(SVM) with implementation
